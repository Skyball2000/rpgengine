# Welcome to the RPG Engine Documentation!
___


Thank you for choosing the RPG Engine as your engine for creating an adventure!
The engine allows for a large amount of customization but also requires quite a lot of work to get into.
  
If you want to create your very own adventure, these are the steps you need to follow in order to learn how to use the engine:

 * Read through [getting started](getting-started.md)
 * Create your [first adventure](first-adventure.md)
 * Read through the rest of the documentation using the drop down menu above from top to bottom
 * Check if you know [everything](other.md)!

If you are using Notepad++ to edit the events, you can download [this UDL](http://yanwittmann.de/projects/rpgengine/rpgengine.xml) (right click and save) to highlight the keywords.
You can find the website and download the RPG Engine on the [main site](http://yanwittmann.de/projects/rpgengine/site/).
