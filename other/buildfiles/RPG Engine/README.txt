
Trouble starting the launcher? You will need at least Java version 11 to run the engine. Since Oracle does not provie JDKs for versions 11 and above, you need to install a JDK. Any of the following downloads will let you run the engine:

You can download the latest jdk here:
https://www.oracle.com/de/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html

You can download the jdk version 11 here which will work as well:
https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html
