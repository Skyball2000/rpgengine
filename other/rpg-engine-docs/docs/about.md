## About me
I'm *Yan Wittmann*, the creator of the RPG Engine!  
This project has started in early 2020 and development went on for almost an entire year. I've spent countless hours making this an engine you can actually create adventures with.  
  
I hope that after you read through the documentation you too can create your very own world!  
If you have any more questions or if you find a bug, feel free to [contact me via mail](mailto:mail@yanwittmann.de?subject=Feedback%20to%20the%20RPG%20Engine) (or using the launcher for templates)!
